# Python 3 Bootcamp Notes

## Description

This repository gather notes I've taking throughout the course:
[The Modern Python 3 Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-modern-python3-bootcamp/) by Cold Steele

## Getting Started

- In `/docs` you can find MD files with all notes
- In `/projects` you can find small projects shown during the course that could help me as use cases in the future
- `main.py` was use as a multi-purpose code tester throughout the course

In order to run any python files, I've created a `docker-compose.yml` file and bash files as helpers.

### Installing

`sh run`: it should run python in a docker container
`sh install <package>`: install packages in the docker environment

### Executing

`sh python <file>`
`docker exec python <command>`: any other command to be run in the container
